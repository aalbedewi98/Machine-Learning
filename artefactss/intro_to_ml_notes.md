# Notes: Introduction to Machine Learning

- **Definition**: Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions/decisions without explicit programming.  
- **Applications in daily life**: Internet browsing, online shopping recommendations, fraud detection, healthcare diagnostics, autonomous driving, banking decisions.  
- **Categories of ML**:  
  - Supervised Learning (predictive modelling, classification, regression).  
  - Unsupervised Learning (clustering, anomaly detection, dimensionality reduction).  
  - Reinforcement Learning (learning by trial and error, robotics, gaming).  

- **Challenges**:  
  - Data quality and biases.  
  - Overfitting and underfitting.  
  - Ethical concerns (privacy, fairness, explainability).  

- **Opportunities**:  
  - Automation of routine tasks.  
  - Improved decision-making.  
  - Enhanced productivity across sectors.  

- **Industry Connection**: ML is at the heart of Industry 4.0 and 5.0, enabling real-time insights, predictive analytics, and humanâ€“machine collaboration.
