# NLP Summarization Project Explanation

## 1. Project Overview
The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical implementation of NLP text summarization using transformer models. We used a small demo dataset of sentences describing NLP concepts and transformers.

We aim to:
- Preprocess text for NLP tasks.
- Apply transformer-based summarization using BART.
- Evaluate summaries using ROUGE metrics.

---

## 2. Dataset
The dataset consists of three short paragraphs about:
1. NLP applications.
2. Transformer models like BERT, GPT, and T5.
3. Data preprocessing importance in NLP.

We stored the dataset in a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation.

---

## 3. Preprocessing
For this simple demo:
- No heavy preprocessing was done since transformers handle tokenization internally.
- In real projects: lowercase text, remove special characters, handle stopwords if needed.

---

## 4. Transformer Summarization
We used HuggingFace `transformers` library with BART (`facebook/bart-large-cnn`) for summarization.
- **BART** is an encoder-decoder transformer that excels at abstractive summarization.
- We set parameters: `max_length=50`, `min_length=20`, `do_sample=False`.

**Pipeline Steps:**
1. Load pre-trained BART model.
2. Input each paragraph.
3. Generate a concise summary.

---

## 5. Evaluation
We used **ROUGE** metrics to evaluate quality:
- **ROUGE-1**: Overlap of unigrams.
- **ROUGE-2**: Overlap of bigrams.
- **ROUGE-L**: Longest common subsequence.

The `rouge_scorer` from `rouge-score` computes these metrics.

---

## 6. Results
- Summaries captured key ideas of each paragraph.
- ROUGE scores provide a quantitative measure of overlap with the original text.
- This workflow can scale to larger datasets with preprocessing, batching, and GPU acceleration.

---

## 7. Key Observations
- Transformers like BART, T5, and PEGASUS are state-of-the-art for summarization.
- Preprocessing helps, but transformers handle tokenization and embeddings internally.
- ROUGE evaluation is a standard but only captures lexical overlap; semantic similarity may require BERTScore or human evaluation.

---

## 8. Future Enhancements
- Apply T5 or GPT-based summarizers for comparison.
- Use large datasets like CNN/DailyMail or XSum.
- Implement batch processing for efficiency.
- Integrate fine-tuning for domain-specific summarization tasks.

# Transformer Models Review - Explanation

## Overview
This artefact provides theoretical background and demos for popular transformer models: BERT, GPT, and T5.

## Models

### BERT
- Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
- Pre-trained for masked language modeling
- Use cases: classification, NER, QA

### GPT
- Decoder-only transformer
- Pre-trained for language generation
- Use cases: text completion, conversation, summarization

### T5
- Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer
- Unified NLP tasks as text-to-text
- Use cases: translation, summarization, QA

## Attention Mechanism
- Multi-head attention allows model to focus on different parts of input simultaneously.
- Queries, Keys, and Values compute weighted importance of tokens.
- Enables transformers to capture long-range dependencies.

## Notes
- Small demo code illustrates input tokenization, model inference, and output decoding.
- Diagrams can be added in `figures/` folder if needed.
