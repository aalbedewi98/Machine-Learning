## 2. Objectives
- Predict potential equipment failures before they occur using sensor data.  
- Apply ML models suitable for time-series and tabular industrial data.  
- Demonstrate practical integration of ML with Industry 4.0 principles.  
- Evaluate and visualize model performance to support decision-making.

## 3. Dataset
- **Source:** Simulated industrial IoT sensor dataset.  
- **Features:**  
  - Temperature, vibration, pressure, and operational load readings.  
  - Timestamp of sensor readings.  
  - Machine status labels (Normal / Fault).  
- **Size:** 100,000 records from multiple machines over 6 months.  

**Preprocessing Steps:**  
1. Checked for missing values and imputed with median values.  
2. Normalized numeric features to range 0–1.  
3. Created lag features for time-series prediction.  
4. Split data into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets.

## 4. Machine Learning Approach
**Models Selected:**  
- Random Forest Classifier for initial baseline.  
- XGBoost for optimized tabular performance.  
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network for sequential/time-series prediction.  

**Rationale:**  
- Random Forest provides robustness and interpretability.  
- XGBoost improves prediction performance with feature importance insights.  
- LSTM captures temporal dependencies in sensor readings for early fault detection.  

**Training and Validation:**  
- Used 5-fold cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning.  
- Monitored validation accuracy and early stopping for LSTM.
