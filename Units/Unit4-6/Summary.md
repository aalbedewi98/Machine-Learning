## Unit 4 – Linear Regression with Scikit-Learn
This unit introduced the application of linear regression using Scikit-Learn. I learned to model relationships between a single independent variable and a dependent variable, as well as between multiple independent variables and a dependent variable.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Applied linear and multivariate regression techniques using Python.
- Learned how to evaluate model effectiveness using metrics such as R² and Pearson correlation.
- Developed understanding of regression assumptions and how to optimize models.
- Enhanced coding proficiency and ability to interpret results critically.

**Linked Learning Outcomes:**
- **LO2:** Understand dataset applicability and challenges in regression modeling.
- **LO3:** Apply and critically appraise linear regression techniques.
- **LO4:** Communicate findings effectively and collaborate professionally.

## Unit 5 – Clustering (Theory and Class Activities)
This unit focused on the theoretical foundations of clustering, including grouping objects, distance measurements, K-Means and Agglomerative clustering, and evaluating clusters. Although no formal seminar was conducted, class activities involved interactive animations and wiki collaboration.

**Class Activities Completed:**
- Watched two clustering animations:  
  1. Standard clustering visualization.  
  2. “I’ll choose” + “Uniform Points” option to explore different initialization effects.  
- Participated in the module wiki activity:  
  - Shared insights about cluster relationships observed in animations.  
  - Commented on peers’ posts to enhance collaborative learning.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Developed understanding of clustering logic and algorithm rationale.  
- Recognized how initial conditions and point distributions impact cluster formation.  
- Gained skills in evaluating cluster quality and identifying potential pitfalls.  
- Strengthened teamwork and peer learning through wiki discussions.

**Linked Learning Outcomes:**
- **LO2:** Understand the principles and challenges of clustering datasets.  
- **LO3:** Apply clustering concepts and critically evaluate results.  
- **LO4:** Communicate insights and collaborate effectively in team-based tasks.

## Unit 6 – Clustering with Python
This unit applied K-Means clustering on real-life datasets using Python and Scikit-Learn. It focused on practical implementation, evaluation, and interpretation of clustering results.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Applied K-Means clustering using Scikit-Learn libraries.  
- Learned to evaluate and interpret clustering results for data-driven decision-making.  
- Strengthened Python programming skills in a practical, real-world context.  
- Updated the e-Portfolio and collaborated on team-based analytical projects.

**Linked Learning Outcomes:**
- **LO2:** Undertake clustering analysis on large datasets and understand data limitations.  
- **LO3:** Use Python libraries to implement and evaluate clustering algorithms.  
- **LO4:** Collaborate professionally, report results, and update the e-Portfolio.

## Reflection
Across Units 4–6, I enhanced my practical ML skills, particularly in regression and clustering. I gained confidence in using Python for data modeling, learned to evaluate results critically, and improved teamwork and communication in analytical tasks. The inclusion of interactive animations and wiki-based peer feedback in Unit 5 highlighted the value of visual and collaborative learning. These units prepared me for more complex data analysis projects and real-world machine learning applications.
