## Unit 4 – Linear Regression
**Feedback (Peer/Tutor Style):**  
- Excellent understanding of linear and multivariate regression concepts.  
- Applied R² and Pearson correlation metrics effectively to evaluate model performance.  
- Clear explanation of regression assumptions and optimization strategies.  
- Practical coding skills in Python were well-demonstrated, showing ability to interpret results critically.  
- Recommendation: Consider adding more examples of how assumption violations affect model accuracy.

## Unit 5 – Clustering (Conceptual & Wiki)
**Feedback (Peer/Tutor Style):**  
- Good grasp of clustering concepts, including K-Means and Agglomerative clustering.  
- Participation in the Module Wiki added value for peers, especially your **K-Means Clustering** entry:
  > *“K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions a dataset into k clusters based on feature similarity. It iteratively assigns data points to the nearest cluster centroid and updates centroids until convergence.  
  > Professional Implications: Understanding clustering helps in customer segmentation, market analysis, and anomaly detection, while considering ethical use of data and bias avoidance.”*  
- Your comment on **Feature Selection Bias** also contributed to peer discussion:  
  > *“I found this explanation very helpful. I would add that regular auditing of models for bias is also important in real-world applications.”*  
- Recommendation: Engage more with peer posts on clustering results to deepen collaborative learning.

## Unit 6 – Clustering with Python
**Feedback (Peer/Tutor Style):**  
- Strong practical application of K-Means clustering using Scikit-Learn.  
- Results interpretation and evaluation were clear and accurate.  
- e-Portfolio updates reflect professional teamwork and good communication of analytical outcomes.  
- Recommendation: Explore additional clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN, Hierarchical) to compare performance and applicability.

## Overall Feedback
- Demonstrates excellent progression from theoretical understanding (Units 4–5) to practical application (Unit 6).  
- Effective use of Python and Scikit-Learn for modeling and clustering.  
- Shows awareness of ethical, legal, and professional considerations in ML projects.  
- Peer contributions via Wiki enhance collaborative learning and reflective practice.
