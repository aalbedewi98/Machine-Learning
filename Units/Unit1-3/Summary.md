## Unit 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This unit focused on preparing and exploring data for ML models. Using the **Auto-mpg dataset**, I handled missing values, encoded features, and visualized distributions and correlations.  
The exercises emphasized data reliability and ethical data handling, in line with Industry 5.0 principles.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Strengthened practical Python skills using **pandas**, **numpy**, and **matplotlib**.  
- Learned how EDA supports ethical and effective ML modeling.  
- Developed problem-solving and analytical reasoning skills.  
- Gained awareness of dataset challenges and bias handling.

**Linked Learning Outcomes:** LO2, LO3, LO4

## Unit 3 – Correlation and Regression
In this unit, I applied **correlation and regression techniques** to quantify relationships and build predictive models.  
Through Jupyter/Colab exercises, I implemented **Pearson correlation**, **simple**, **multiple**, and **polynomial regression**, evaluating performance using metrics such as **R²**.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Learned how correlation identifies relationships and assists in feature selection.  
- Applied regression methods for prediction and analysis of linear/non-linear data.  
- Understood model assumptions and the importance of validation.  
- Enhanced coding proficiency and critical interpretation of results.

**Linked Learning Outcomes:** LO2, LO3, LO4

## Reflection
Across Units 1–3, I gained both **technical competence** and **critical awareness** of how ML operates within social and ethical boundaries.  
These activities improved my ability to:
- Apply ML techniques (EDA, regression) to structured datasets.  
- Critically assess data integrity and model assumptions.  
- Collaborate effectively and communicate technical findings.  

This foundational phase prepared me for more advanced ML topics and future professional applications in AI-driven cybersecurity and smart systems.
