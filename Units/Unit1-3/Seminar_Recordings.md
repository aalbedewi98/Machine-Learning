## Unit 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

### Seminar Preparation  
**Date:** 12 August 2025  
**Time:** 19:00 BST  
**Platform:** Kaplan Virtual Classroom  

**Objectives:**  
- Understand the concept, purpose, and workflow of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.  
- Learn how to validate, clean, and visualize datasets effectively.  
- Apply EDA concepts to the **Auto-mpg dataset** in Python.  
- Prepare for integration of EDA findings into the team project.  

**Preparation Activities:**  
- Completed the **EDA Tutorial** using Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab.  
- Identified and handled missing values in datasets.  
- Estimated skewness and kurtosis for numerical variables.  
- Created correlation heatmaps and scatter plots for variable relationships.  
- Replaced categorical values with numeric encodings (America = 1, Europe = 2, Asia = 3).  
- Reviewed sample notebooks and peer exercises.  

**Artefacts:**  
- [EDA_Notebooks](../../Units/Unit1-3/Artefacts/Unit02_Eda_Notebooks.ipynb)

### Seminar Summary  
**Overview:**  
The live session provided a practical walkthrough of EDA using Python, covering key preprocessing and visualization techniques and linking them to the team project’s analytical phase.

**Key Points:**  
- Steps of EDA: data cleaning → transformation → visualization.  
- Identification of outliers, anomalies, and correlations using heatmaps.  
- Use of **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib** for analysis.  
- Introduction to dimensionality reduction techniques such as **PCA**.  
- Emphasis on ethical data handling and reproducibility.  
- Team project updates and guidance for submitting artefacts to the e-Portfolio.  

**Reflection:**  
EDA provided a deeper understanding of dataset integrity and how preprocessing affects model performance.  
Practicing visualization strengthened my technical and analytical abilities.  
Although I worked individually, following tutorials and peer contributions enhanced my independence, reflective learning, and confidence in handling data ethically.

**Learning Outcomes Linked:**  
- **LO1:** Address ethical and professional considerations in ML projects.  
- **LO2:** Identify dataset challenges and apply suitable EDA techniques.  
- **LO3:** Critically appraise ML methods through hands-on data exploration.  
- **LO4:** Strengthen virtual collaboration and independent learning skills.
