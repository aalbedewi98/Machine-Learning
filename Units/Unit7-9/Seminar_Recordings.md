### Seminar Summary

**Overview:**  
The session, led by Dr. Steph Paladini, focused on emerging research and applications of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), highlighting their impact across industries. Ethical considerations of AI use in personal insurance were discussed from a customer perspective. Key ANN concepts and preparation for training models using CIFAR-10 were emphasized for practical understanding.  

**Key Points:**  
- ANN applications can improve automation, decision-making, and predictive accuracy in selected areas.  
- Deep learning is a subset of machine learning; model choice depends on data availability, computational resources, and transparency requirements.  
- Ethical and practical concerns in AI-based insurance include data privacy, bias, transparency, and potential financial or reputational risks.  
- ANN training involves critical parameters: weights, biases, activation functions, loss function, optimizer, learning rate, batch size, and epochs.  
- Effective teamwork and preparation improve clarity in presenting technical and ethical viewpoints.
