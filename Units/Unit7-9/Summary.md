## Reflection Note – Gradient Descent
- **Learning Rate Impact:** High learning rate → fast but unstable convergence; Low → stable but slower.
- **Iteration Impact:** More iterations → closer convergence to minimum cost; fewer iterations → incomplete learning.
- **Connection to ANN:** Gradient descent principles are directly applicable to backpropagation in neural networks.
