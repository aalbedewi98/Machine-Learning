### Seminar Title: EDA Tutorial

**Task Summary:**  
Completed the EDA tutorial using Jupyter Notebook (via Essex Software Hub or Google Colab) and applied similar exploratory analysis to the Auto-mpg dataset.  

**Key Activities Undertaken:**  
1. Identified missing values in the dataset.  
2. Estimated skewness and kurtosis for numeric variables.  
3. Created correlation heatmaps to understand variable relationships.  
4. Generated scatter plots for different parameters to visualize patterns.  
5. Replaced categorical values with numerical codes (e.g., America=1, Europe=2, Asia=3).  
6. Observed outputs and reflected on dataset applicability for ML.  

**Reflection:**  
- EDA helped in understanding **dataset structure, variability, and anomalies**, essential before applying ML.  
- Improved practical skills in **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib** for preprocessing and visualization.  
- Even without direct team participation, reviewing tutorials and peers’ examples reinforced **critical thinking and analytical skills**.  
- Recognized the importance of ethical and professional considerations when handling real-world datasets.  

**Learning Outcomes Linked:**  
- **LO1:** Articulate legal, social, ethical, and professional issues in ML projects.  
- **LO2:** Understand the applicability and challenges associated with datasets for ML.  
- **LO3:** Apply and critically appraise ML techniques to real-world problems with technical risks and uncertainties.  
- **LO4:** Develop and implement skills to be an effective member of a virtual professional team.
