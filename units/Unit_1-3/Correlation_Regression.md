# Unit 3: Correlation and Regression â€“ Seminar & Exercises

**Required Reading:**  
- Bishop, C. and Bishop, H. (2024) *Deep Learning: Foundations and Concepts*, UK: Cambridge University Press.  
  - Chapter 4: Regression Models in Machine Learning  

### Overview
Correlation measures relationships between variables; regression predicts outcomes and trends. Both are foundational in ML and AI.

### Learning Objectives
- Theoretical understanding of correlation and regression  
- Compute correlation and regression  
- Apply these techniques in real-world scenarios  

### e-Portfolio Activities
1. Run correlation and regression programs in Jupyter/Colab:  
   - `covariance_pearson_correlation.ipynb`  
   - `linear_regression.ipynb`  
   - `multiple_linear_regression.ipynb`  
   - `polynomial_regression.ipynb`  
2. Observe changes in data points and impacts on models  
3. Document screenshots and outputs for artefacts

### Artefacts
- [Correlation & Regression Notebooks](../../artefactss/correlation_regression_notebooks.ipynb)  
- [Screenshots of Outputs](../../artefactss/correlation_regression_screenshots.png)  
- Peer discussion summaries

### Learning Outcomes Linked
- LO2: Analysis of datasets  
- LO3: Communication of results  
- LO4: Reflection on applicability and challenges
