# Unit 3: Correlation and Regression – Seminar & Exercises

**Required Reading:**  
- Bishop, C. and Bishop, H. (2024) *Deep Learning: Foundations and Concepts*, UK: Cambridge University Press.  
  - Chapter 4: Regression Models in Machine Learning  

---

### Overview
Correlation measures relationships between variables, helping to identify patterns and dependencies. Regression models predict outcomes based on input variables. Both techniques are foundational for ML applications, including prediction, feature selection, and anomaly detection.  

---

### Learning Objectives
- Develop a theoretical understanding of correlation and regression  
- Compute correlation and regression coefficients for datasets  
- Apply these techniques to observe how changes in data impact predictions  
- Visualize relationships using scatter plots, regression lines, and polynomial curves  

---

### e-Portfolio Activities
1. **Run correlation and regression programs in Jupyter/Colab:**  
   - Pearson correlation: calculated relationships between variables, visualized with scatter plots  
   - Simple linear regression: predicted outcomes for one independent variable, observed regression line fit  
   - Multiple linear regression: predicted outcomes based on multiple variables, evaluated coefficients and intercept  
   - Polynomial regression: fitted 3rd-degree polynomial models, predicted values for new data points, calculated R² score  

2. **Change data points to observe effects:**  
   - Modifying input data affected the correlation coefficient, regression slope/intercept, and polynomial predictions  
   - Visualized changes in scatter plots and regression curves  

3. **Document outputs and observations for artefacts:**  
   - Screenshots and saved notebooks capture code, outputs, and plots for e-portfolio  

---

### Reflection
- Running all four regression and correlation programs improved practical skills in Python, NumPy, SciPy, pandas, and scikit-learn  
- Observing how changes in data affected correlation and regression outputs reinforced understanding of relationships between variables  
- Learned how linear and polynomial regression models differ in fitting data, and the importance of checking R² for model performance  
- Even without direct peer collaboration, reviewing tutorials and outputs enhanced critical thinking and comprehension of statistical analysis in ML

### Artefacts
- [Correlation & Regression Notebooks](../../artefacts/Unit03_correlation_regression_notebooks.ipynb) – contains combined code, outputs, and plots  

---

### Learning Outcomes Linked
- **LO2:** Analyze datasets to compute correlation and regression coefficients  
- **LO3:** Communicate results effectively using plots, predictions, and interpretation  
- **LO4:** Reflect on applicability, limitations, and challenges of correlation and regression for ML tasks
