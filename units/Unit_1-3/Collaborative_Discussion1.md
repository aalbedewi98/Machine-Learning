## Unit 1 – Introduction to Machine Learning

### Metcalf (2024) – Industry 4.0 / 5.0 Discussion
Metcalf (2024) highlights that Industry 4.0 brought automation, IoT, and AI integration to modern industries, but also created vulnerabilities such as cybersecurity threats and over-reliance on digital systems. Industry 5.0 builds on this by emphasising human-centric innovation, resilience, and sustainable practices.

**My Sector: Cybersecurity & Public Services**  
As someone working in the Information Systems Department within a governmental body, the shift to Industry 5.0 is directly relevant. Digital transformation (Industry 4.0) has already improved service delivery, but cyber threats like ransomware remain a risk (similar to the NHS WannaCry case). Industry 5.0 encourages designing secure, human-focused digital systems that are resilient and socially responsible.

**Key Reflections:**  
- Industry 4.0 = efficiency and automation.  
- Industry 5.0 = human–machine collaboration, resilience, social impact.  
- For Qatar’s public services, Industry 5.0 means embedding cybersecurity, transparency, and sustainability into smart city initiatives.

**Learning Outcomes Linked:** LO2 (analysis), LO3 (communication), LO4 (reflection)

## Unit 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Overview
EDA is valuable to data science (and AI) projects since it ensures the results will be valid, correctly interpreted, and applicable to business contexts. This is achieved after validating raw data and checking for anomalies. EDA also helps identify hidden insights valuable to stakeholders and data scientists.

**Learning Goals:**  
- Steps involved with EDA  
- Feature exploration  
- Spotting anomalies  
- Visual analysis of datasets

**My Sector: Cybersecurity & Public Services**  
EDA supports detecting anomalies in system logs, validating datasets, and improving ML model performance. In the context of Industry 5.0, it ensures human oversight, ethical use of data, and resilience of systems.

**Key Reflections:**  
- EDA = clean, reliable data for ML and AI applications  
- Industry 4.0 = automated data processing; Industry 5.0 = human-guided analysis  
- For Qatar’s public services, EDA under Industry 5.0 enhances secure, transparent, and resilient decision-making

**Learning Outcomes Linked:** LO2, LO3, LO4

## Unit 3 – Correlation and Regression

### Overview
Correlation and regression quantify and describe relationships between variables. Correlation measures the strength and type of relationship, while regression provides equations for predicting unseen values.

**Learning Goals:**  
- Core aspects of correlation and regression  
- Techniques to measure them  
- Applications in real-world scenarios

**My Sector: Cybersecurity & Public Services**  
Correlation and regression models can predict potential system failures or detect abnormal activity. Industry 5.0 emphasizes resilience, ethical use, and human oversight in predictive analytics.

**Key Reflections:**  
- Correlation = variable relationships; Regression = predictive modeling  
- Industry 4.0 = automated insights; Industry 5.0 = resilient, human-supervised predictions  
- Public services in Qatar must integrate security, transparency, and social accountability in predictive models

**Learning Outcomes Linked:** LO2, LO3, LO4  

**Artefacts:**

- [Screenshots of Outputs](../../artefactss/correlation_regression_screenshots.png)  
- [Peer Contributions Summary](../../artefactss/peer_notes.md)
