### Metcalf (2024) – Industry 4.0 / 5.0 Discussion

Metcalf (2024) highlights that Industry 4.0 brought automation, IoT, and AI integration to modern industries, but also created vulnerabilities such as cybersecurity threats and over-reliance on digital systems. Industry 5.0 builds on this by emphasising human-centric innovation, resilience, and sustainable practices.

**My Sector: Cybersecurity & Public Services**  
As someone working in the Information Systems Department within a governmental body, the shift to Industry 5.0 is directly relevant. Digital transformation (Industry 4.0) has already improved service delivery, but cyber threats like ransomware remain a risk (similar to the NHS WannaCry case). Industry 5.0 encourages designing secure, human-focused digital systems that are resilient and socially responsible.

**Key Reflections:**  
- Industry 4.0 = efficiency and automation.  
- Industry 5.0 = human–machine collaboration, resilience, social impact.  
- For Qatar’s public services, Industry 5.0 means embedding cybersecurity, transparency, and sustainability into smart city initiatives.  

**Learning Outcomes Linked:** LO2 (analysis), LO3 (communication), LO4 (reflection).
