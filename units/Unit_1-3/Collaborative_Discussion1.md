## Unit 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Task Summary:**  
Performed EDA on sample datasets, including the Auto-mpg dataset, to validate, clean, and explore data. Prepared visual analyses and identified anomalies relevant to ML applications in cybersecurity.

**Results:**  
- Completed dataset validation and cleaning, including handling missing values (`horsepower`) and encoding categorical data (`car name`, `origin`).  
- Created visualizations such as scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, and histograms to highlight patterns and anomalies.  
- Enhanced understanding of dataset applicability and challenges for machine learning.  

**Reflection:**  
- EDA ensures reliable and ethical data usage for ML models.  
- Improved technical skills in Python (Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook) and visual interpretation.  
- Recognized the importance of human oversight in Industry 5.0 data practices and ML decision-making.  

**Learning Outcomes Linked:**  
- **LO2:** Understand the applicability and challenges of datasets for ML.  
- **LO3:** Apply EDA techniques critically to real-world datasets.  
- **LO4:** Collaborate on group tasks, sharing findings and documenting in the e-portfolio.

## Unit 3 – Correlation and Regression

**Task Summary:**  
Performed correlation and regression analyses to examine relationships between variables. Applied models to predict system behaviour and detect anomalies.

**Results:**  
- Produced correlation matrices and regression models.  
- Interpreted predictive relationships and statistical significance.  
- Applied models to hypothetical public service datasets to simulate anomaly detection.

**Reflection:**  
- Correlation = understanding relationships; Regression = predictive modeling.  
- Learned the practical value of predictive analytics for resilient and secure public systems.  
- Strengthened critical thinking by evaluating the performance and applicability of different models.

**Learning Outcomes Linked:** **LO2, LO3, LO4**
