## Unit 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Task Summary:**  
Performed EDA on the Auto-mpg dataset to validate, clean, and explore data. Identified missing values, encoded categorical features, and visualized patterns and anomalies.

**Results:**  
- Completed dataset cleaning, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.  
- Visualized data using scatter plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps.  
- Enhanced understanding of dataset applicability and challenges for ML, particularly in predictive modeling.

**Reflection:**  
- EDA ensures ethical and reliable data usage in ML.  
- Improved skills in Python (Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook) for preprocessing and visualization.  
- Recognized the importance of human oversight in data practices and Industry 5.0 principles.  
- Even without direct peer collaboration, observing tutorials and common practices helped develop critical thinking in data analysis.

**Learning Outcomes Linked:**  
- **LO2:** Gained understanding of dataset validation, cleaning, and visualization for ML applications.  
- **LO3:** Applied exploratory data analysis techniques to identify patterns, anomalies, and correlations.  
- **LO4:** Reviewed peers’ contributions and tutorials to develop analytical and collaborative skills.

## Unit 3 – Correlation and Regression

**Task Summary:**  
Learned and applied correlation and regression techniques to quantify relationships between variables and predict outcomes. Explored practical applications using sample datasets in Python.

**Results:**  
- Calculated Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients to assess linear and monotonic relationships.  
- Built simple linear regression models to predict outcomes and evaluated model fit using R² and residual analysis.  
- Visualized relationships with scatter plots, regression lines, and heatmaps.  
- Improved understanding of how correlation informs feature selection and regression aids predictive modeling.

**Reflection:**  
- Understanding correlation helps in feature selection and identifying multicollinearity.  
- Regression analysis allows prediction but requires careful checking of assumptions (linearity, independence, homoscedasticity).  
- Enhanced practical skills in Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib) for statistical analysis.  
- Peer discussions and tutorials reinforced understanding of theoretical concepts and practical implementation.

**Learning Outcomes Linked:**  
- **LO2:** Understood the use of correlation and regression for analyzing relationships between variables.  
- **LO3:** Applied statistical methods to predict outcomes and assess model performance.  
- **LO4:** Reflected on peers’ examples and tutorials to reinforce learning and professional practice.

**Artefacts:**  
- [Correlation & Regression Notebook](../../artefacts/correlation_regression_notebook.ipynb) – contains code, outputs, and visualizations.  
- [Tutorial Reference](https://your-unit3-tutorial-link.com) – lecturecast, SCORM package, or reading material.
