# Collaborative Discussion 1 – Units 1-3

---

## Unit 1 – Introduction to Machine Learning

**Task Summary:**  
Participated in a discussion on Industry 4.0 and 5.0, analyzing implications for cybersecurity and public services. Shared insights on automation, IoT, AI integration, and potential vulnerabilities.

**Results:**  
- Gained understanding of Industry 4.0 vs Industry 5.0 concepts.  
- Identified key cybersecurity risks and strategies for public services.  
- Improved communication and collaboration skills within a team.

**Reflection:**  
- Industry 4.0 = efficiency and automation; Industry 5.0 = human–machine collaboration, resilience, social impact.  
- Learned the importance of embedding security, transparency, and sustainability in digital transformation initiatives.  
- Applied critical thinking to connect ML concepts with real-world public sector challenges.

**Learning Outcomes Linked:** **LO2, LO3, LO4**

## Unit 3 – Correlation and Regression

**Task Summary:**  
Learned and applied correlation and regression techniques to quantify relationships between variables and predict outcomes. Explored practical applications using sample datasets in Python.

**Results:**  
- Calculated Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients to assess linear and monotonic relationships.  
- Built simple linear regression models to predict outcomes and evaluated model fit using R² and residual analysis.  
- Visualized relationships with scatter plots, regression lines, and heatmaps.  
- Improved understanding of how correlation informs feature selection and regression aids predictive modeling.

**Reflection:**  
- Understanding correlation helps in feature selection and identifying multicollinearity.  
- Regression analysis allows prediction but requires careful checking of assumptions (linearity, independence, homoscedasticity).  
- Enhanced practical skills in Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib) for statistical analysis.  
- Peer discussions reinforced understanding of theoretical concepts and practical implementation.

**Learning Outcomes Linked:** **LO2, LO3, LO4**

**Artefacts:**  
- [Correlation & Regression Notebook](../../artefacts/correlation_regression_notebook.ipynb) – contains code, outputs, and visualizations.  
- [Tutorial Reference](https://your-unit3-tutorial-link.com) – lecturecast, SCORM package, or reading material.
