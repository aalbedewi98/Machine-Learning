## Reflection

This e-portfolio demonstrates my progression through Units 1–3, combining theoretical learning, practical exercises, and analysis of peers’ contributions. I improved my technical skills in Python, data preprocessing, visualization, correlation, and regression, while reflecting on ethical and professional practices in ML.  

By documenting my learning and linking artefacts, I have created a **clear, professional record** of my work suitable for assessment and future reference.
