# Reflective Piece

During the Machine Learning module, I learned both technical and professional skills.  
Here are the main reflections:

- **Challenges Faced:** Explain any difficult tasks or concepts (e.g., regression, CNN models).  
- **Skills Developed:** Python programming, Excel, team collaboration, time management, critical thinking.  
- **Learning Outcomes Achieved:** Link back to LO1â€“LO4.  
- **Next Steps:** How I will apply this knowledge in future projects or learning.
