## Reflection
- Observing peer contributions enhanced my understanding of **ethical, social, and professional issues in ML** (LO1).  
- I learned how different sectors apply Industry 4.0/5.0 principles and the importance of resilience, human oversight, and ethical governance.  
- This activity improved my **communication, critical thinking, and collaboration skills** (LO3, LO4).  
- I applied these insights to my own analysis of cybersecurity and public services, linking theory to real-world applications.
