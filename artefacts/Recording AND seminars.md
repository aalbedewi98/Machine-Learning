- # Unit 2 Seminar – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Date:** Tuesday, 12th August 2025  
**Time:** 19:00 BST  
**Tutor:** Liz Coulter-Smith (liz.coulter-smith@kaplan.com)  

---

## Overview
This live seminar focused on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and provided a practical walkthrough of EDA techniques using Python platforms (Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook). The session also included guidance on progressing with the team project and using the e-portfolio effectively.

**Objectives:**  
1. Understand the steps involved in EDA and its importance in machine learning.  
2. Learn techniques to explore, validate, and visualize datasets.  
3. Apply EDA methods to the Auto-mpg dataset and prepare for team project analysis.

## Topics Covered
- EDA Introduction and Importance  
- Dataset Validation and Cleaning  
- Feature Exploration and Selection  
- Visual Analysis: Scatter plots, Correlation Heatmaps, Histograms  
- Identifying Anomalies and Outliers  
- Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis  
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)  
- Team Project Updates and e-portfolio discussion  
- Reading Resources and Python Tools (Colab, Jupyter, Kaggle)  
- Q&A  

---

## Key Points
- EDA is critical to ensure **data quality and reliability** before applying ML algorithms.  
- Visualizations help uncover patterns, correlations, and anomalies that may not be obvious in raw data.  
- Python tools (Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook) are essential for performing and documenting EDA efficiently.  
- Regular team discussions and progress updates ensure smooth completion of the group project.  
- Examples and tutorials provided helped practice **missing value handling, categorical encoding, skewness/kurtosis estimation, and feature correlations**.
