## Key Points

### Definition
- Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions/decisions without explicit programming.

### Applications
- Internet browsing recommendations  
- Online shopping recommendations  
- Fraud detection  
- Healthcare diagnostics  
- Autonomous driving  
- Banking decisions

### Categories of ML
- **Supervised Learning:** Predictive modelling, classification, regression  
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Clustering, anomaly detection, dimensionality reduction  
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Learning by trial and error, robotics, gaming

### Challenges
- Data quality and biases  
- Overfitting and underfitting  
- Ethical concerns: privacy, fairness, explainability

### Opportunities
- Automation of routine tasks  
- Improved decision-making  
- Enhanced productivity across sectors

### Industry Connection
- ML drives Industry 4.0 (automation, predictive analytics) and Industry 5.0 (human–machine collaboration, ethical design, resilience).
