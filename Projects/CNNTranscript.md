## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Transcript:**  
“Hello, my name is Ajayeb, and today I will present my project on Neural Network Models for Object Recognition using CNNs and Transfer Learning.  
In this project, I focus on applying Convolutional Neural Networks, data augmentation, and fine-tuning pre-trained models on the CIFAR-10 dataset to classify images into 10 object categories.”

## Slide 2: Table of Contents
**Transcript:**  
“In this slide, I present the content overview of my presentation. We start with the project objectives and dataset overview, followed by data preprocessing and augmentation. Next, I will explain the CNN architecture and transfer learning approach using VGG16. Then, we cover training strategies, hyperparameters, performance visualization, and evaluation on the test set. Finally, I discuss comparative analysis, strengths, limitations, lessons learned, and conclude with references.”

## Slide 3: Objectives
**Visual:** Bullet points of project objectives  
**Transcript:**  
“The objectives of this project are:  
1. Prepare and explore the CIFAR-10 dataset, including training, validation, and test splits.  
2. Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch.  
3. Apply data augmentation to improve model generalization.  
4. Use transfer learning with VGG16, adding custom layers for CIFAR-10 classification.  
5. Fine-tune the top layers of VGG16 to improve performance.  
6. Evaluate the model with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, and classification report.  
7. Discuss the strengths, limitations, and trade-offs of CNN and transfer learning approaches.”

## Slide 4: Dataset – CIFAR-10
**Visual:** Table summarizing dataset stats + grid of 5x5 sample images  
**Transcript:**  
“The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 color images of size 32x32 pixels across 10 classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.  
I split the data into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, then further split the training set into 40,000 images for training and 10,000 images for validation.  
Visualizing 25 sample images helps inspect class diversity and confirm data integrity before training.”

## Slide 5: Data Preprocessing & Augmentation
**Visual:** Flowchart: Load → Normalize → Split → Augment  
**Transcript:**  
“This slide presents the data preparation phase.  
- Load the dataset containing all images.  
- Normalize pixel values from 0–255 to 0–1 for numerical stability.  
- Split into training, validation, and test sets.  
- Apply data augmentation (rotations, width/height shifts, horizontal flips) to training set only.  
These steps improve model generalization and prevent overfitting.”

## Slide 6: CNN Architecture
**Visual:** Diagram: Conv → Pool → Dense → Dropout → Output  
**Transcript:**  
“The model begins with convolutional layers to extract features, pooling layers to reduce dimensions, dense layers for feature combination, dropout to prevent overfitting, and softmax output for classification.”

## Slide 7: Transfer Learning Concept
**Visual:** VGG16 base + custom classifier top layers diagram  
**Transcript:**  
“Transfer learning adapts a pre-trained model (VGG16) for CIFAR-10.  
Original top layers removed, replaced with global average pooling, dense layer (256 neurons), dropout, and 10-class softmax output.”

---

## Slide 8: Initial Training (Frozen Base)
**Visual:** Flowchart showing frozen base → custom layers → output  
**Transcript:**  
“Base layers of VGG16 frozen, only classifier layers trained for 5 epochs with Adam optimizer (lr=0.001, batch=64).  
Training accuracy and loss monitored to prevent overfitting.”

---

## Slide 9: Fine-Tuning Top Layers
**Visual:** Highlight top layers of VGG16 being unfrozen  
**Transcript:**  
“Top layers unfrozen and trained with smaller learning rate (1e-5).  
Fine-tuning captures dataset-specific patterns, improving validation accuracy and reducing loss.”

---

## Slide 10: Hyperparameters & Training Strategy
**Visual:** Table of hyperparameters + line plots (Accuracy & Loss)  
**Transcript:**  
“Both CNN and VGG16 use Adam, batch size 64, dropout 0.5, and data augmentation.  
CNN: 10 epochs, lr=0.001  
VGG16: Initial 5 epochs lr=0.001 → fine-tune 3 epochs lr=1e-5.  
Line plots show training/validation accuracy and loss; fine-tuning improves performance.”

## Slide 11: Training & Performance Visualization
**Visual:** Accuracy vs Epochs, Loss vs Epochs  
**Transcript:**  
“Learning curves show steady increase in accuracy and decrease in loss.  
Data augmentation helps generalization, confirming model learned meaningful features.”

---

## Slide 12: Evaluation on Test Set
**Visual:** Confusion matrix heatmap + test accuracy table  
**Transcript:**  
“Fine-tuned VGG16 achieved 68% test accuracy vs CNN’s 55%.  
Precision, recall, F1-score ~0.67.  
Confusion matrix highlights class-specific performance: high accuracy for airplane, automobile, ship; lower for cat vs dog.”

## Slide 13: Comparative Discussion
**Visual:** Table comparing Classical ML vs CNN vs Transfer Learning  
**Transcript:**  
“SVM/KNN: manual features, low accuracy.  
CNN: automatic features, medium accuracy, needs GPU.  
Transfer Learning: reuses pre-trained features, fast and accurate, potential source-target mismatch.”

**Transcript:**  
“Automatic feature extraction, reduced training time, better generalization with augmentation and fine-tuning, scalable to larger datasets.”

## Slide 15: Limitations & Trade-offs
**Visual:** Icons with bullets  
**Transcript:**  
“Requires GPU, fine-tuning gave modest improvements, confusion for similar classes, sensitive to hyperparameters.”

**Transcript:**  
“Validation sets, data augmentation, fine-tuning improved robustness.  
Metrics like precision, recall, F1-score provided deeper insight.
